# Grezi

*Make high quaity presentations, quickly and easily*

## About

Grezi was inspired by the **groff** document creator. In groff, if you learn the syntax, you can quickly and easily make academic looking documents. If you use groff, all the formatting symantics are done for you automatically.

I wanted to create something that follows the same paradigm, but for presentations. Instead of having to align everything manually, I wanted everything to simply align itself. And that's how Grezi was born!

## GRZ Format

Grezi interprets `.grz` files and plays them in fullscreen. The `grz` format was designed to be elegant and elicit fast parsing with minimal RAM usage.

## Opening presentations

On windows, you can open presentations by dragging the `.grz` file onto the `grezi_skia.exe` file. On other operating systems, grezi takes presentations as a command line argument.

## Features of Grezi

*   Write presentations as text files
*   Move text and images between slides
*   Looks very good
*   Better than Google Slides
*   Free and open source

## Glaring errors

*   Weird and bad errors
*   "Found end of input", where there really shouldn't be. My laptop will open presentations, my desktop won't. I don't know how to fix this, but I accept PR's
