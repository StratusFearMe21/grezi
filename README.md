# Grezi

*Make high quaity presentations, quickly and easily*

## About

Grezi was inspired by the **groff** document creator. In groff, if you learn the syntax, you can quickly and easily make academic looking documents. If you use groff, all the formatting symantics are done for you automatically.

I wanted to create something that follows the same paradigm, but for presentations. Instead of having to align everything manually, I wanted everything to simply align itself. And that's how Grezi was born!

## GRZ Format

Grezi interprets `.grz` files and plays them in fullscreen. The `grz` format was designed to be elegant and elicit fast parsing with minimal RAM usage.
